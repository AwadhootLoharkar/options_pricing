# Quantum Fourier Transform for Option Pricing - Workflow

## Objective:
To use Fourier transform methods to calculate the characteristic function of an asset's price distribution,
implement the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for option pricing, and compare the quantum implementation with classical methods.

---

## Workflow:

### Day 1: Understand Financial and Quantum Concepts
- Study Fourier-based methods for option pricing (e.g., Heston model).
- Review Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE).
- Understand Black-Scholes as a benchmark for comparison.

### Day 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Obtain historical price data for the underlying asset (Yahoo Finance, Quandl).
- Preprocess data: Calculate log returns, volatility, and drift terms.
- Visualize price trends and verify data quality.

### Day 3: Classical Fourier Analysis for Option Pricing
- Implement classical Fourier transform for characteristic function calculation.
- Use inverse Fourier transform to calculate option prices.
- Test the implementation with sample parameters.

### Day 4: Quantum Fourier Transform Implementation
- Build QFT circuits using Qiskit or similar frameworks.
- Map financial data to quantum states for simulation.

### Day 5: Quantum Phase Estimation for Option Pricing
- Implement Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) for pricing integration.
- Simulate and compare results with classical Fourier methods.

### Day 6â€“7: Quantum-Classical Hybrid Comparisons
- Compare classical and quantum approaches:
  - Accuracy
  - Computational efficiency
- Experiment with different volatility and maturity values.

### Day 8: Optimization and Visualization
- Optimize quantum circuits for accuracy.
- Visualize option price variations with parameters.

### Day 9: Report and Presentation
- Write a detailed report with:
  - Introduction to the methods.
  - Implementation details.
  - Results and comparisons.
- Include circuit diagrams and plots.

### Day 10: Final Testing and Submission
- Perform end-to-end testing of the implementation.
- Prepare for live demonstrations.
- Submit report and code files.
