# Changes to Variables for Different Outputs

## Ticker Symbol
- Change the `ticker` variable to the desired stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple, "AMZN" for Amazon).

## Date Range
- Modify the `start_date` and `end_date` variables to set the desired date range for fetching stock data.

## General Parameters for Option Pricing
- `S0`: Initial stock price. This is fetched from the stock data. Ensure the stock data is correctly fetched for accurate `S0`.
- `K`: Strike price. Adjust the multiplier (e.g., `1.05`) to set the strike price relative to the current stock price.
- `k`: Log strike price. This is derived from `K`.
- `r`: Risk-free interest rate. Change this value to reflect the current or expected risk-free rate.
- `q`: Dividend yield. Adjust this value based on the expected dividend yield of the stock.
- `T`: Time to maturity. Modify this value to set the option's time to maturity (e.g., `0.5` for 6 months).

## FFT Parameters
- `n`: Exponent for 2^n. Change this value to adjust the number of steps in the FFT calculation.
- `N`: Number of steps. This is derived from `n`.
- `eta`: Integration step size. Adjust this value to change the precision of the numerical integration.
- `alpha`: Damping factor. Modify this value to affect the smoothness of the FFT-generated option price curve.
- `lambda_`: Log-strike step size. This is derived from `N` and `eta`.
- `beta`: Log-strike value. This is derived from `K`.

By adjusting these variables, you can tailor the option pricing model to different scenarios and requirements.
